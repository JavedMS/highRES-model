1. Currently the build_weather rule which takes a lot of resources to run (time,
    memory, cpu) depends on the highres.ods file. This means it will be rerun,
    even when there are no changes relevant for it. After changing to csv files,
    we should be able to have it only read csv files that are relevant to it.
